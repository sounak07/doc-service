Design and implement a Simple document Service where users can create documents and read the same.
A document has a name and associated string content.

All documents are private when created.
Owners of documents can {grant} {read OR edit} access to other users
Only the owner can delete a document
Username will be just a string. Every action like create/read/edit/delete must be made on behalf of a user
